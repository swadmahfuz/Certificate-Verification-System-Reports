<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/swadmahfuz/Certificate-Verification-System-Inspection)
<br />
<h2  align="center">üõ°Ô∏è TUV Austria Inspection Certificate Verification System </h2>

<h3>üìå Overview </h3></br>

<p>This application is designed to address the persistent challenges of inspection/calibration certificate forgery and inefficient manual verification processes that our organization, TUV Austria, has frequently encountered. The primary goal of this tool is to enhance operational efficiency and accuracy in the authentication of certificates and reports.</p>

<h3>üóÇÔ∏è Key Features </h3></br>

* Database Management üìÅ: Maintains a comprehensive database of certificates and reports, streamlining the storage and retrieval process.
* QR Code Verification üì±: Enables clients and other stakeholders to verify the authenticity of certificates and reports swiftly using QR codes.
* TUV Austria Employee Dashboard üñ•Ô∏è: Allows TUV Austria employees to efficiently manage certificate data, including adding, editing, and removing entries.
* Versatility üîß: While primarily focused on certificates, the application‚Äôs architecture allows for future adaptations, such as verifying product authenticity or third-party reports.
</br>

<h3>üöÄ Benefits </h3> </br>

* Time Efficiency ‚è≥: Significantly reduces the time spent by employees on manual verification processes.
* Security üõë: Enhances the integrity of the verification process, helping to prevent fraud and unauthorized use of falsified documents.
* User-Friendly ü§ù: Provides a user-friendly interface for both administrative tasks and verification processes.

<h3>üåü Potential Expansions</h3></br>
<p>This project holds potential for further modifications to accommodate a broader range of verification needs, including but not limited to product authenticity and third-party reports. A complimenting app has also been developed for Training Certificate Verification that uses the same database, which runs from a separate directory. </p>
